    <h2>Image of a S'mores Brownies</h2>
      <p> These delicious brownie s'mores let you enjoy the popular campfire 
        treat on top of a brownie. I consider myself a gourmet cook and originally 
        thought these would just appeal to kids, but everyone loves them! </p>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (18.3 ounce) package fudge brownie mix (such as Betty Crocker®) </li>

        <li>½ cup vegetable oil </li>
            
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
            
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
            
        <li>6 graham crackers</li>
            
        <li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
            
        <li>8 (1.5 ounce) bars milk chocolate, coarsely chopped</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
             Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Make the brownies: Stir brownie mix, oil, eggs, and water together in a medium bowl until well blended. 
            Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the brownies are baking, make the topping: Break graham crackers into 1-inch pieces and place into a bowl.
             Add marshmallows and chopped chocolate and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove brownies from the oven and sprinkle with topping ingredients. 
            Return to the oven and continue to bake until a toothpick inserted 2 inches from the side of the pan comes out clean, 
            7 to 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
